# How to read the charts

**K-Means clusters (map)**  
Dots with similar “felt” temperature are colored together. Use it to spot broad warm/cool zones.

**DBSCAN clusters (map)**  
Finds compact hotspots; outliers are labeled as noise (−1). Use it to see concentrated risk areas.

**Forecast (line chart)**  
Next 24–48h temperature with a shaded uncertainty band. Compare baseline with +1.5 °C / +2 °C scenarios.
