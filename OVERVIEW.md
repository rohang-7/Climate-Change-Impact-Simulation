# Climate Change Impact Simulation — The Idea (for everyone)

**Problem in one line:** Some parts of Melbourne feel much hotter than others; warming will amplify that.

**What this project does:** Shows **where heat clusters** are today and **how temperatures might shift** under +1.5 °C / +2 °C.

## What I built (without jargon)
- A small **map** that colors dots by how hot places “feel” together (hotspot clusters).
- A **short-term forecast** of temperature.
- A **warming slider** (+1.5 °C / +2 °C) to compare futures.

## Key takeaways
- Hotter clusters often align with **less tree cover** and denser built form.
- “Feels-like” temperature can rise faster than measured temp on **humid** days.
- A 2050-style high-emission scenario suggests ~**+1.8 °C** average increase and **more variability**.

## Who can use this
- **Councils & planners:** target trees, cool roofs, and shade.
- **Schools & aged care:** plan heat-safe schedules and cool spaces.
- **Residents:** understand and advocate for local cooling.

## Limits (being honest)
- Repo includes a **tiny sample** so anyone can run it; live pulls need an API key.
- Clusters use a **simple feature set**; adding land use/trees improves accuracy.
- Forecasts include **uncertainty**—guidance, not guarantees.
